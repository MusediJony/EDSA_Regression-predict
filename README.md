# EDSA_Regression-predict

## This Repository is one created for the Regression project by Explore Data Science Academy.

### The project was conducted on Zindi, https://zindi.africa/, an online platform that hosts competitions. 

Zindi connects professional organisations around the world with a thriving African Data Science community to use machine learning and AI to solve challanges to can help those organisation make professional decisions.

The competition instructs to predict the time it will take riders to deliver orders for a logistics company called sendy, by building a machine learning model.

The metric that was used for this this competition was the Root Mean Squared error (RMSE) with a passmark if your RMSE is below 800 (50% achieved at 799 and 100% achieved for a RMSE of 730 and below). 

I personally obtained an RMSE score of 750 with a position rank of 40 out of 275 individuals/groups that participated in the competion.

The latter link above takes you to the actual competition. You can then click on the leaderboard and see my profile at position 40.
